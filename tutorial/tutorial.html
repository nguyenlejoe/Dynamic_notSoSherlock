          <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
          <p>
            Hey there! In this game you will be playing as legendary detective
            Sherlock! You'll go through the game using inductive and deductive
            skills to determine what crimes happened and who committed them.
            Best of luck!

          <h2>What is Inductive Reasoning?</h2>
          <p>
            Think of it as... determining things from bottom to top! You form an
            opinion based on something you observe. <br />
            <br />
            For example: <br />
            1. All the basketballs I've played with are leather. <br />
            2. That means all basketballs are made of leather.

        <h2>What is Deductive Reasoning?</h2>
        <p>
          It's kind of like thinking about things from the top down! You form a
          question and then argue against it. If there's no arguments to be
          made, the question is true! <br />
          <br />
          For example: <br />
          1. Dogs go woof woof <br />
          2. Cherrie goes woof woof <br />
          3. Therefore Cherrie is a dog.
